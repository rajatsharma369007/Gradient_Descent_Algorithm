# Gradient Descent Algorithm

## Introduction
In this notebook, I have implemented a gradient descent algorithm from scratch using numpy to train a linear model. Gradient descent is a first-order iterative optimization algorithm for finding the minimum of a function.

## Dataset
Have a look at the dataset [link](https://github.com/rajatsharma369007/Gradient_Descent_Algorithm/blob/master/data.csv)  
The first 2 columns are x and y coordinates with last column as the labels.

## Issue/Bug
Please open issues on github to report bugs or make feature requests.

## Contribution
If you are interested in improving the code, please open an issue first to describe the task you are planning to do. For small fixes (a few lines of change) feel free to open pull requests directly.
